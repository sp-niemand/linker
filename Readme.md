# Linker

## Description

An exercise in Python/Django, inspired by http://getpocket.com/.

There is a need for a rather simple link-sharing app connected to my current workplace's auth system.

Adding links will be done through a bookmarklet for starters. Chrome extension will follow.

Work has only just been started.

## Environment

Python 3

    pip install -r requirements.txt
